\section{Related Projects Implemented in Portugal}
\subsection{MEO Beachcam}
MEO Beachcam is a digital platform that provides real-time information about the beaches of mainland Portugal.
\\
\indent The platform provides around the clock video transmission of the beaches through a network of cameras. In addition to the live video feeds, MEO Beachcam provides extensive meteorological data, including: weather conditions, temperature, wind strength and direction, sea state and UV index. Besides being accessible on the platform, the aforementioned data is also available to security forces and rescue services for monitoring and emergency response. In addition to the oceanographic buoys and weather stations for data collection, the platform also employs the use of Artificial Intelligence for analyzing wave patterns and better predict weather conditions. 
\\
\indent The project is committed to expand and enhance its coastal monitoring infrastructure. Future plans for development include the expansion of the existing camera network and the deployment of drone technology to capture aerial imagery, all of this while seeking to increase the number of monitored beaches throughout mainland Portugal.

\subsection{Info Praia}
Info Praia is a mobile app developed by the \ac{apa}  with the purpose of provide actualized information during the bathing season on many of the beaches of Portugal.
\\
\indent It provides information on the beach occupation, and occupation prediction based on data of registered homologues days. The data used for the daily weather forecast is provided by the Instituto Portugues do Mar e da Atmosfera, I.P (IPMA, I.P). The data about the tides  is provided by the Instituto Hidrogr√°fico. The water quality is monitored by the APA at least four times for each bathing season to verify the bathing suitability and display its suitability in the app. Furthermore, is displayed by the app real-time video transmitted by the MEO Beachcam platform analyzed previously.
\subsection{Praia 5G}
Praia 5G is a joint initiative between NOS and Almada city council to launch the first 5G beach in Portugal. This project has the objective of demonstrating how the 5G network technology, artificial intelligence and video analysis can transform the security and management of beaches.
\\
\indent The beach was equipped with a 5G network to support all the functionalities implemented. One of the functionalities is the automated monitorization of persons, objects and vessels. This functionality includes the detection of risk situations, automated alerts for the responsible entities and it uses artificial vision cameras in vigilance towers that process in real time the images through machine learning algorithms allowing immediate response in emergency situations. Another functionality is the monitorization and management of the beach occupation which includes automatic counting the number of visitors and their respective entry and exit times and the capacity to estimate the concentration of people per area of the beach. Lastly, the management of residues is elaborated by the readings of sensors that measure the garbage bins capacity.
\\
\indent This project has the future perspective of implementing functionalities such as drowning detection, children and lost objects localization through artificial intelligence. Also, it is intended to use drones for real time data of weather conditions and to increase the sustainability expand the system to detect garbage in the sea with the possibility of the use of cleaning robots.
